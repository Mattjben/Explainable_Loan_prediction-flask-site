          <p>
            
            The aim of this model is to provide an equitable service that can be used by small financial brokers or loan providers to assess the suitability of a potential client who does not
            has limited financial history with that provider. This model takes only 10 features of the potential client’s financial situation and can return a
            recommendation as to whether the loan to the client will be risky or not. The model is an explainable model, and therefore will explain the 
            models exact reasoning as to what factors of the potential client’s financial situation lead the recommendation the model made. If not 
            all the necessary information is known the model will also take this into account and still return a recommendation. This is helpful for smaller
            brokers who do not have the large databases and customer history or financial means to create their own models.

        <h2><b>Definitions and special values:</b></h4>
          <p>            
            <b>Inquiry:</b> Hard credit inquiries which occur when a creditor has requested to look at your credit file (e.g., when applying for new credit card) <br>
            large amounts of inquires on a file could indicate uncertainty /instability (e.g. filing for multiple cards at once)
            <br>
            <b>Inq excl 7days:</b> Generally, multiple inquires made within the same 7 days are attributed to price comparison shopping and therefore aren’t an indication of instability 
            <br>
            <b>Derogatory comment:</b> Negative item in your credit reports (e.g. caused by 180+ days late payments , creditor takes possession of property due to non-payment , files for bankruptcy etc.) 
            <br>
            <b>Delinquency:</b> Refers to a payment received some period past its due date
            <br>
            <b>Instalment trade:</b> Credit agreements you make to pay an account over time (e.g., home loan)
            <br>
            <b>Revolving trade:</b> A credit agreement that provides you with a credit limit you’re allowed to use and pay back over time. 
            <br>
            <b>-9:</b> No Bureau Record or No Investigation (Missing value)      
            <br>     
            <b>-8:</b> No Usable/Valid Accounts Trades or Inquiries - inactive/very old account
            <br>                       
            <b>-7:</b> Condition not Met (e.g., someone has no delinquencies in the last 12 months, different form 0 as 0 means no delinquencies ever)  </p>
